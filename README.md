# EthOps
Developer Tools to manage and monitor drones, UAVS and medical embedded devices for cost effective healthcare delivery,  patient monitoring, first aid delivery. Monitoring tools for water management and reducing water wastage. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and cleaner drinking water, Remote Water Monitoring, Recyclability of Water.

Inspiration: Remote water monitoring systems have not been used effectively in emerging countries. We got motivated to recycle and use old phones and tablets, used devices like computers on providing remote water monitoring facility to prevent havoc in case of hurricanes, excessive rainfall. Chennai floods in 2015 has made it all the more urgent to design, develop and deploy such systems cost effectively.

Plan:  Our vision is to carry out research on new models that incorporate technology and which aims at revolutionizing the water management practices around the world . The technology solution is designed specifically to address the needs of the water, health and environment eco-system comprising of civic bodies, water management units, hospitals, environment and health ministry, laboratories, citizens, R&D organizations and improve the operational efficiencies.

Just in Time service Availability of city’s water records suffering from environmental issues across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network.

Record Management Quality documentation reduces the issues regarding implementation of water management policies.

Research Research laboratories can use the data for diagnosis of water borne diseases, suggesting personalized action to water treatment plants.

4.Web Application Cloud-based web application with a chat-based interface for quick water wastage attention. It can also be used for environment protection and steps to reduce the issues.

Transparency Insurance agencies can utilize the data to provide customized house insurance plans to the customer. Ground water levels are at an all time low.

Better Management Practices Journal of water usage records covering complete city history improve the policy implementation and help define stringent rules towards saving water.

We are planning to develop a platform powered by ethereum and its key solutions having the following features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.

Tools Utilized:

1. Tableland: We are using tableland to develop a monitoring notes application and are maintaining it along with maintenance and security notes of drones and UAVs. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Module1/Monitoring-Notes-tableland

2. NFTPort: We are using NFTPort to see all NFTs from different networks. This enables UAV Users:UAV Users can views their NFTs in different network when they enter their address and select the network such as Ethereum, Polygon (Matic), Avalanche, and Binance Smart ChainUAV Users can view the contract of the NFT such as floor price, unique token ids sold today, gas quote rate day, and list of NFTs mintedPlease visit: https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Module1/NFTs-from-different-networks

3. NFT.Storage for Filecoin/IPFS: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMbdCn79woH2TGFCF_sH-oGDZEuzjm7f (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS/filecoin to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Module2/incidentandalarmstorage

4. Unstoppable Domains: We are utilizing 4 unstoppable domains for authentication, authorization and identity/access management. 
Please visit the link: https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Module1/Unstoppable-Domains-login/uns-login-moduleThe project domain "ethops.blockchain" has been purchased from UNS along with other 3 domains "ethercalc.nft", "ethercalc.wallet" and "ethercalc.blockchain".

5. Aave governance for extensibility of drone governance on Optimism and Arbitrum: We are using Aave cross chain bridges to extend drone governance to other blockchain networks like Optimism and Arbitrum. 
Please visit
https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Drone-robotics-governance
Governance of Drones and UAVs using Aragon Plugins: A decentralized survey for drone ratings by users using a governance solution built with Aragon plugins at the core is done at key intervals and its onchain voting snapshots enable credibility of ratings. 
We can enable our smart contracts read the storage of any contract at a given block. This enables on-chain voting, airdrops on Ethereum and Polygon. Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Drone-Survey-Ratings and https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Drone-robotics-governance

6. Optimism: We are using Optimistic rollup technology to enable scaling of the decentralized public goods mobility network and effective management and communication setup for Drones utilized in Operations and Maintenance across multiple regions. Drones can be effectively utilized for building operations, inspection and maintenance and safer and more efficient surveys.Please visit the Optimism faucet configuration screenshots: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZJQc1qsTT0DA7haYnA0lG2w-lH_iSUAs

SuperFluid + UMA: We are using Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets UAV users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for Drones utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending Superfluid’s streaming tokens with UMA’s KPI Options: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. UAV Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating.
