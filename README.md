# EthOps
Developer Tools to manage and monitor drones, UAVS and embedded devices for cost effective healthcare delivery and integrated water management. Monitoring tools for water management and reducing water wastage. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and cleaner drinking water, Remote Water Monitoring, Recyclability of Water.

Inspiration: Remote water monitoring systems have not been used effectively in emerging countries. We got motivated to recycle and use old phones and tablets, used devices like computers on providing remote water monitoring facility to prevent havoc in case of hurricanes, excessive rainfall. Chennai floods in 2015 has made it all the more urgent to design, develop and deploy such systems cost effectively.

We are planning to develop a platform powered by ethereum and its key solutions having the following features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.
