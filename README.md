# EthOps
Developer Tools to manage and monitor drones, UAVS and embedded devices for cost effective healthcare delivery and integrated water management. Monitoring tools for water management and reducing water wastage. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and cleaner drinking water, Remote Water Monitoring, Recyclability of Water.

Inspiration: Remote water monitoring systems have not been used effectively in emerging countries. We got motivated to recycle and use old phones and tablets, used devices like computers on providing remote water monitoring facility to prevent havoc in case of hurricanes, excessive rainfall. Chennai floods in 2015 has made it all the more urgent to design, develop and deploy such systems cost effectively.

Plan:  Our vision is to carry out research on new models that incorporate technology and which aims at revolutionizing the water management practices around the world . The technology solution is designed specifically to address the needs of the water, health and environment eco-system comprising of civic bodies, water management units, hospitals, environment and health ministry, laboratories, citizens, R&D organizations and improve the operational efficiencies.

Just in Time service Availability of city’s water records suffering from environmental issues across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network.

Record Management Quality documentation reduces the issues regarding implementation of water management policies.

Research Research laboratories can use the data for diagnosis of water borne diseases, suggesting personalized action to water treatment plants.

4.Web Application Cloud-based web application with a chat-based interface for quick water wastage attention. It can also be used for environment protection and steps to reduce the issues.

Transparency Insurance agencies can utilize the data to provide customized house insurance plans to the customer. Ground water levels are at an all time low.

Better Management Practices Journal of water usage records covering complete city history improve the policy implementation and help define stringent rules towards saving water.

We are planning to develop a platform powered by ethereum and its key solutions having the following features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.
