Resolution is a library for interacting with blockchain domain names. It can be
used to retrieve
[payment addresses](https://unstoppabledomains.com/learn/how-to-send-crypto-using-your-domain)
and IPFS hashes for
[decentralized websites](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001181925-build-website).

Resolution is primarily built and maintained by
[Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).

Resolution supports different decentralized domains. Please, refer to the [Top Level Domains List](https://resolve.unstoppabledomains.com/supported_tlds)

For more information, see our detailed
[API Referrence](https://unstoppabledomains.github.io/resolution/).

## Installing Resolution

Resolution can be installed with either `yarn` or `npm`.

```shell
yarn add @unstoppabledomains/resolution
```

```shell
npm install @unstoppabledomains/resolution --save
```

If you're interested in resolving domains via the command line, see our
[CLI section](#command-line-interface).

## Updating Resolution

Resolution can be updated with either `yarn` or `npm`.

```shell
yarn upgrade @unstoppabledomains/resolution --latest
```

```shell
npm update @unstoppabledomains/resolution --save
```

## Using Resolution

Create a new project.

```shell
mkdir resolution && cd $_
yarn init -y
yarn add @unstoppabledomains/resolution
```

### Look up a domain's crypto address

Create a new file in your project, `address.js`.

```javascript
const {default: Resolution} = require('@unstoppabledomains/resolution');
const resolution = new Resolution();

function resolve(domain, currency) {
  resolution
    .addr(domain, currency)
    .then((address) => console.log(domain, 'resolves to', address))
    .catch(console.error);
}

resolve('brad.crypto', 'ETH');
resolve('brad.zil', 'ZIL');
```

Execute the script.

```shell
$ node address.js
brad.crypto resolves to 0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8
brad.zil resolves to zil1yu5u4hegy9v3xgluweg4en54zm8f8auwxu0xxj
```

### Find the IPFS hash for a decentralized website

Create a new file in your project, `ipfs_hash.js`.

```javascript
const {default: Resolution} = require('@unstoppabledomains/resolution');
const resolution = new Resolution();

function resolveIpfsHash(domain) {
  resolution
    .ipfsHash(domain)
    .then((hash) =>
      console.log(
        `You can access this website via a public IPFS gateway: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/${hash}`,
      ),
    )
    .catch(console.error);
}

resolveIpfsHash('homecakes.crypto');
```

Execute the script.

```shell
$ node ipfs_hash.js
You can access this website via a public IPFS gateway: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVJ26hBrwwNAPVmLavEFXDUunNDXeFSeMPmHuPxKe6dJv
```

### Find a custom record

Create a new file in your project, `custom-resolution.js`.

```javascript
const {default: Resolution} = require('@unstoppabledomains/resolution');
const resolution = new Resolution();

function resolveCustomRecord(domain, record) {
  resolution
    .records(domain, [record])
    .then((value) => console.log(`Domain ${domain} ${record} is: ${value}`))
    .catch(console.error);
}

resolveCustomRecord('homecakes.crypto', 'custom.record.value');
```

### Command Line Interface

CLI support was removed from the Resolution library starting from version 6.0. Please use the [standalone CLI tool](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-cli).

## Default Ethereum Providers

Resolution provides zero-configuration experience by using built-in
production-ready [Alchemy](http://alchemy.com/) endpoint by default.  
Default Ethereum provider is free to use without restrictions and rate-limits
for `UNS` resolution.

## Custom Ethereum Provider configuration

You may want to specify a custom provider:
 - if you want to use a dedicated blockchain node
 - if you want to monitor app usage
 - if you already have a provider in your app to re-use it for domain resolution

Default provider can be changed by changing constructor options
`new Resolution(options)` or by using one of the factory methods:

- `Resolution.alchemy()`
- `Resolution.infura()`
- `Resolution.fromWeb3Version1Provider()`
- `Resolution.fromEthersProvider()`
- etc.

To see all constructor options and factory methods check
[Unstoppable API reference](https://unstoppabledomains.github.io/resolution).

```javascript
const {default: Resolution} = require('@unstoppabledomains/resolution');

const ethereumProviderUrl = ALCHEMY_ETHEREUM_API;
const polygonProviderUrl = ALCHEMY_POLYGON_API;

// custom provider config using the `Resolution` constructor options
const resolution = new Resolution({
    sourceConfig: {
      uns: {
        locations: {
          Layer1: {
            url: ethereumProviderUrl,
            network: 'mainnet'
          },
          Layer2: {
            url: polygonProviderUrl,
            network: 'polygon-mainnet',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });
```

## Autoconfiguration of blockchain network

In some scenarios system might not be flexible enough to easy distinguish
between various Ethereum testnets on compile time. For this case Resolution
library provide a special async constructor which should be waited for
`await Resolution.autonetwork(options)`. This method makes a JSON RPC
"net_version" call to the provider to get the network id.

This method configures only Uns. Zns is supported only on Zilliqa mainnet which
is going to be used in any cases. You can provide a configured provider or a
blockchain url as in the following example:

```
await Resolution.autoNetwork({
  uns: {provider},
});
```

## Error Handling

When resolution encounters an error it returns the error code instead of
stopping the process. Keep an eye out for return values like `RECORD_NOT_FOUND`.

## Development

Use these commands to set up a local development environment (**macOS Terminal**
or **Linux shell**).

1. Install `nvm`

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Install concrete version of `node.js`

   ```bash
   nvm install 16.15.0
   ```

3. Install `yarn`
   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```
4. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution.git
   cd resolution
   ```

5. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Internal config

#### To update:

- Network config: `$ yarn network-config:pull`
- Resolver keys: `$ yarn resolver-keys:pull`
- Both configs: `$ yarn config:pull`
