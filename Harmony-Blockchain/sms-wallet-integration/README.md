# SMS Wallet

The SMS Wallet is a lightweight non-custodial wallet solution for users to quickly create a wallet bound to their phone number, receive (or purchase) inexpensive NFTs, showcase their NFTs, and to hold a small amount of crypto assets. The wallet primarily operates on a mobile browser, and is recoverable using text message verification codes in combination with a QR code saved by the user during the walletâ€™s creation.
