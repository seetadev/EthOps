Near Protocol and Aurora: We are using Aurora to enable scaling of the network and effective management and communication setup for Drones utilized in Operations and Maintenance across multiple regions. Aurora enables dApps to easily move to the NEAR blockchain. It allows users to do two distinct things: upload and interact with Solidity smart contracts on NEAR blockchain and move assets (including ERC-20 tokens) between Ethereum, NEAR and Aurora via the Rainbow Bridge. Please visit the link: https://github.com/seetadev/EthOps/tree/main/Module2/scaling-with-aurora We are also utilizing Near Protocol to receive drone and UAV incident feedback, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they could strategize more productively and do early stage prevention of collisions.

Steps:

- Solidity contract deployment using (Truffle/Hardhat).
- Integration with Metamask
- Running DApp on Aurora network

## Prerequisites
- Node 12+

## Examples
- [Truffle](truffle/)
- [Hardhat](hardhat/)

More documentation about Aurora network can be found [here](https://doc.aurora.dev/develop/networks).

## Contributing
Aurora team welcomes any kind of contributions in form of bug issues, feature requests, code changes, or documentation enhancement.
