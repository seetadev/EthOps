We are utilizing Near Protocol to receive drone and UAV incident feedback, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they could strategize more productively and do early stage prevention of collisions.

Steps:

1. How to receive $NEAR on a contract.
2. How to store and retrieve information from the blockchain.
3. How to use a `Vector`.
4. How to interact with a contract from `React JS`.
